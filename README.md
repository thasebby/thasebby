### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sebastian Saenz and I am currently preparing myself to embark a life changing journey. I have been working in the hospitality business for the past 8 years and am working to get into the tech space. I embarked in a six month full stack bootcamp through UCF and learned a base line of information that will help me reach where I want to be. 

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

Ever since I completed the course in April 2024, I have been making sure all of my ducks are in a row. This includes managing my personal portfolio, my resume and making sure my GitHub profile looks good enough to present.

### ðŸŒ± My goals

Short term I would like to expand on the knowledge that I have already acquired. Throughout the bootcamp I realized that I am very interested in all aspects of front-end deveelopment and working with/creating data tables of information. 

### âš¡ Outside of tech

In my personal life I enjoy hanging out with my friends and traveling as much as I can. I also pride myself in playing adult leage kickball, it's another reason to get my steps in ðŸ˜„.
